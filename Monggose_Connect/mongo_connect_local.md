Error [ERR_UNSUPPORTED_DIR_IMPORT]: Directory import ...
🧠 Reason:
You are using ES Module syntax (import) in index.js, without telling Node.js that this is an ES module project.

By default, Node treats .js files as CommonJS, not ES Modules.
That’s why it can’t understand import and throws this confusing error.

🧨 What Actually Happened Internally:
Node tried to resolve import something from "nodemon" (or similar)

It hit a directory, not a file

Since it’s in CommonJS mode by default, Node doesn't support importing directories via import without .js or .mjs file extensions

✅ Solution Recap:
You must do one of these 3 things:

✅ Option 1: Add "type": "module" in package.json
Then your import/export code works.

✅ Option 2: Rename file to .mjs
So Node knows to treat it as an ES module.

✅ Option 3 (Simplest): Switch to CommonJS
Use require() instead of import and remove "type": "module".
